# ParkWatch SG — Complete Specification

## Overview

ParkWatch SG is a Telegram bot that crowdsources real-time parking warden sightings across Singapore. When a user spots a warden, they report it, and all users subscribed to that zone receive instant alerts.

**Core Value Proposition:** Save drivers from parking tickets by providing real-time, community-driven warden location alerts.

### Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Bot Framework | python-telegram-bot 21+ (async) |
| Language | Python 3.10+ |
| Config | python-dotenv |
| Database (dev) | SQLite via aiosqlite |
| Database (prod) | PostgreSQL via asyncpg (connection pooling) |
| Migrations | Alembic (versioned schema changes) |
| Logging | Structured JSON or human-readable text (`bot/logging_config.py`) |
| Error Tracking | Sentry (optional, via `sentry-sdk`) |
| Health Check | Asyncio HTTP server (`GET /health`) |
| Testing | pytest + pytest-asyncio (257 tests) |
| Linting | ruff (lint + format) |
| Type Checking | mypy |
| CI | GitHub Actions (lint, typecheck, test on 3.10/3.11/3.12) |
| Hosting | Local / Railway / Render / VPS |

### Database Schema

Data is stored in 6 tables with 5 indexes. Tables are created automatically on startup via `bot/database.py`. Schema changes are tracked via Alembic migrations in `alembic/versions/`.

```sql
-- User accounts, report counts, and warning tracking
users (telegram_id BIGINT PK, username TEXT, report_count INT, warnings INT DEFAULT 0, created_at TIMESTAMP)

-- Zone subscriptions (many-to-many)
subscriptions (telegram_id BIGINT, zone_name TEXT, created_at TIMESTAMP, PK(telegram_id, zone_name))

-- Warden sighting reports (with moderation flag)
sightings (id TEXT PK, zone TEXT, description TEXT, reported_at TIMESTAMP,
           reporter_id BIGINT, reporter_name TEXT, reporter_badge TEXT,
           lat REAL, lng REAL, feedback_positive INT, feedback_negative INT,
           flagged INT DEFAULT 0)

-- Feedback votes on sightings (FK cascades on sighting deletion)
feedback (sighting_id TEXT REFERENCES sightings(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
         user_id BIGINT, vote TEXT, created_at TIMESTAMP, PK(sighting_id, user_id))

-- Admin audit log (Phase 8)
admin_actions (id INTEGER PK AUTOINCREMENT, admin_id BIGINT, action TEXT,
              target TEXT, detail TEXT, created_at TIMESTAMP)

-- Banned users (Phase 9)
banned_users (telegram_id BIGINT PK, banned_by BIGINT, reason TEXT, banned_at TIMESTAMP)
```

The database driver is selected automatically based on `DATABASE_URL`:
- No URL or `sqlite:///` prefix → SQLite (local file)
- `postgresql://` or `postgres://` prefix → PostgreSQL (connection pool, 2–10 connections)

---

## Spam Prevention & Moderation

1. **Rate Limiting**: Max 3 reports per user per hour
2. **Duplicate Detection**: GPS-aware — reports in the same zone within 5 mins are checked:
   - If both reports have GPS coordinates: duplicate only if within **200 meters** (Haversine distance). Reports further apart are allowed through, enabling multiple wardens in the same zone.
   - If either report lacks GPS: falls back to zone-level duplicate detection (same zone = duplicate).
   - Users without GPS receive a tip encouraging them to share location for better accuracy.
3. **Accuracy Tracking**: Low-accuracy reporters flagged with ❌
4. **Community Moderation**: Multiple 👎 ratings reduce trust
5. **Self-Rating Blocked**: Reporters cannot rate own sightings
6. **User Banning** (Phase 9): Admins can ban abusive users via `/admin ban`. Banned users cannot use any commands except `/start`. Bans clear subscriptions and notify the user.
7. **Content Moderation** (Phase 9): Admins can delete false sightings via `/admin delete`. Sightings are auto-flagged when negative feedback exceeds 70% (3+ votes). `/admin review` shows the moderation queue.
8. **Warning System** (Phase 9): Admins can warn users via `/admin warn`. After 3 warnings (configurable via `MAX_WARNINGS`), users are automatically banned.

- [x] User stats tracking

### Stability & UX ✅
- [x] Rate limiting (3 reports/hour)
- [x] GPS-aware duplicate detection (Haversine, 200m radius)
- [x] Multi-zone toggle subscription
- [x] ConversationHandler state machine (6 states, 300s timeout)
- [x] Native GPS share button

### Persistence ✅
- [x] Dual-driver database (SQLite / PostgreSQL)
- [x] Data persists across restarts
- [x] Accuracy from full history (SQL aggregates)
- [x] Scheduled cleanup (every 6 hours)

### Robustness ✅
- [x] Alert messages from structured DB data
- [x] Blocked user cleanup
- [x] Global error handler

### Bug Fixes (Phase 5) ✅
- [x] Timezone-aware datetime throughout
- [x] Collision-proof sighting IDs (UUID4)
- [x] Transaction-safe feedback updates
- [x] Rate limit timing fix
- [x] Foreign key constraints with cascading deletes
- [x] Proper Python packaging (relative imports)

- [x] UX discoverability (richer `/start` menu with inline keyboard actions)

### Phase 11: Admin — Operations (Dependency-ordered)
- [ ] **11.3 Runtime config first**: `config_overrides` + typed runtime setting accessor + allowlist/validation + audit old→new values
- [ ] **11.1 Maintenance mode second**: persisted flag, report-conversation cancellation strategy, inline/query blocking, health degraded status, job soft-pause checks
- [ ] **11.2 Data management third**: purge sightings (manual vs scheduled distinction), purge by zone, GDPR-complete user purge (including feedback given + recompute counters), CSV-first export
- [ ] Add explicit Phase 11 test plan before closure

### Phase 12: Growth Features (Re-scoped and prioritized)
- [ ] 12.4 Deep linking/referrals first (schema + dedupe + GDPR cleanup integration)
- [ ] 12.1 Leaderboards next (`/leaderboard`, defined windows, privacy opt-out)
- [ ] 12.2 Inline mode after maintenance/ban parity and redaction/caching policy
- [ ] 12.3 Replace "heatmaps" with text-first activity summaries initially
- [ ] Move i18n to Phase 14 (scope too large for this phase)

### Phase 13: Monetisation (Split into separate workstreams)
- [ ] 13.A Freemium (policy, billing integration, grandfathering, compliance)
- [ ] 13.B Sponsored alerts (labeling, moderation, frequency caps, opt-out)
- [ ] 13.C Business API (separate product/infrastructure)
- [ ] Add KPI validation gates before any monetisation launch

### Phase 14: Internationalization (i18n)
- [ ] Move i18n out of growth backlog into dedicated phase
- [ ] Extract strings, add locale files, and language preference storage
- [ ] Add `/language` command and baseline locales (`en`, `zh`)
- [ ] Add i18n test coverage and fallback behavior checks
